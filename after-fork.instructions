* Edit `README.md` and replace placeholder text with real information
* Change `src/favicon.ico`
* Change the site's theme colors in `src/theme/theme-colors.scss`

* Update paths to logos (`*LogoSrc`) in `src/app.component.ts`
* Change header and footer configuration in `src/app.component.ts` and `src/app.component.html`
* Configure the cookie banner in `src/app.component.ts` and `src/app.component.html` according to what kind of cookies or data your site will save to the user's machine
